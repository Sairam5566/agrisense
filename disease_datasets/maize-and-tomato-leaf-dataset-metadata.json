If you recognize any of the images, please notify me for proper attribution.\n\n## Augmentation\n\nData augmentation techniques applied include:\n\n- Horizontal and vertical flipping\n- Rotation (random degrees)\n- Color adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation)\n- Random zoom and cropping\n\n# Dataset CSV Description\n\nThis CSV file contains metadata for the dataset used in this project. It provides mappings between image file paths and their corresponding labels (classes). This format is commonly used for supervised learning tasks such as image classification.\n\n## CSV Structure\n\n| Column Name | Description                              |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------|\n| \u0060image_path\u0060| Relative or absolute path to the image file. |\n| \u0060label\u0060     | Class label associated with the image.  |\n\n### Example\n\n| image_path                                   | label              |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| crop_data/tomato/Tomato_Late_blight/img1.jpg | Tomato_Late_blight  |\n| crop_data/maize/Maize_Healthy/img2.jpg       | Maize_Healthy       |\n\n## Usage\n\n- The \u0060image_path\u0060 column points to the location of each image file relative to the dataset root directory.\n- The \u0060label\u0060 column indicates the category or class that the image belongs to.\n- This CSV can be used to load images and their labels programmatically for training or evaluation of machine learning models.\n- Ensure the paths in the CSV are consistent with your file system or dataset folder structure.\n\n## Notes\n\n- The labels correspond to the categories of diseases or healthy conditions of plant leaves.\n- Images should be preprocessed (resized, normalized) as needed before feeding into a model.\n- Augmentation techniques can be applied during training to improve model robustness.\n"}
